# Notification logger tweak for jailbroken iOS/iPadOS
Writes a bunch of info for each incoming notification to local storage

Tested on iOS 15.4.1 dopamine, probably works on newer iOS as well idk

MANUALLY create the folder /var/jb/var/mobile/Documents/notifications/ because the tweak won't create it for you

furee use
